Taking Colt Steel's Bootcamp
Colt who has been a bootcamp instructor for a while, has decided to unleash a Mean stack bootcamp on Udemy.
Although it is not a complete mean stack (some things are missing) it is very in depth. I am sure he will finish it as he goes.

I encourage anyone to buy this course on udemy. Just type Colt Steel udemy bootcamp. You will pull it up.

I will keep my collection of training within this repository.
